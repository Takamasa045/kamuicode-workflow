Create an elegant 10-second text animation video where "I'm grateful" appears first with a gentle fade-in effect, each letter materializing gracefully from golden particles. After 3 seconds, "to el san" emerges from below with smooth upward motion, accompanied by subtle glow effects. The typography should be sophisticated and readable, with generous letter spacing. Golden particles continuously drift across the scene, and delicate cherry blossom petals fall gently throughout. The overall movement should be slow and meditative, conveying heartfelt gratitude with Japanese aesthetic sensibility. End with a soft fade-out as both text elements harmonize together. Maintain cinematic quality with smooth transitions and premium visual effects.
